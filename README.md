# Innomatics Research Labs - Todo-Application by using Javascript Assignment(Internship)

This project(TASK 5) was completed as part of my internship with Innomatics Research Labs. A web-based Todo application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. 
This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. Built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, it features local storage to save tasks across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a name, due date, category, and priority level.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks to update their details.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed**: Track completed tasks with checkboxes.
- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks based on their status (All, Completed, Pending).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after a page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality, including task management and local storage operations.

## Usage
- Add a Task: Enter the task name, select a due date, category, and priority, then click the "Add Task" button.
- Edit a Task: Click the pencil icon next to the task to populate the input fields, make changes, and save.
- Delete a Task: Click the trash icon to remove the task from the list.
- Mark as Completed: Check the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
- Filter Tasks: Use the filter buttons to view all tasks, completed tasks, or pending tasks.
## Code Structure
- index.html: The main HTML file that structures the application.
- styles.css: Custom styles for the application.
- script.js: Contains JavaScript for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks, along with local storage management.
